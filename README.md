# slow-time
Slow time, a watchface for the Pebble aplite, basalt and chalk.

This watchface was originally intended to be a "slow time" watchface, hence the name, but it sort of evolved into a
watchface that highlights minutes.

The minutes are thus displayed prominently in the center, with a triangle pointing to the position on the circle
where the circumference of the circle represents 24 hours starting from the bottom and going clockwise around.

Below the minutes is the day and date.

Inside the circle are arcs representing the remaining battery life (outer arc, orange on colour pebbles) in percent
and (if pebble health is enabled) the progress to your average step count (inner arc, green).

If you exceed your average daily step count, the arc will "overflow" with a new arc indicating how much of your daily
average you have exceeded (indigo on colour, white on b/w pebbles).
